## Definition Versions

Versions require Prowlarr Cardigann C# modifications.
Prowlarr will fall back to a previous version if no YML exists for the current version.

## Schemas

Each Cardigann Version has a YML Schema for it contained within the definitions's respective folder named `schema.json`
For more specific details between versions the schema files can be compared.

To test a definition file against a specific schema use the command below.

Note that the following npm packages are required `ajv-cli-servarr ajv-formats`  These can be installed globally on your system with
