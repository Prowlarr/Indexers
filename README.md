## Defintions from Jackett

With [some differences](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Indexers/issues/370) and a few exceptions Prowlarr Cardigann Indexers are synced upstream with [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) via the [indexer-sync sync in this repository](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Indexers/blob/master/scripts/indexer-sync-v2.sh). Syncs are executed manually by the Prowlarr Team and Contributors; however, any user may [pull request](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Indexers/compare) a sync.

## Definition Versions

Versions require Prowlarr Cardigann C# modifications.
Prowlarr will fall back to a previous version if no YML exists for the current version.

## Schemas

Each Cardigann Version has a YML Schema for it contained within the definitions's respective folder named `schema.json`
For more specific details between versions the schema files can be compared.

To test a definition file against a specific schema use the command below.

Note that the following npm packages are required `ajv-cli-servarr ajv-formats`  These can be installed globally on your system with

```bash
npm install -g ajv-cli-servarr ajv-formats
```

To test the definition:

```bash
 ajv test -d "definitions/v{VERSION}/{INDEXER FILE NAME}.yml" -s "definitions/v{VERSION}/schema.json" --valid -c ajv-formats --spec=draft2019
```
